- Retry: https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration 
  if env vars for CI is true retry will be on in CI but not locally
  // retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,   // no retry 0 
  // retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 2, // retry 2 times
  // or
  retries: 2 //retry two times

- Parallel run: https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel
    /* Opt out of parallel tests on CI. */
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined, // By default there will be 1 worker in the ci. Locally undefined so, no parallel run. Defaults to half of the number of logical CPU cores

- trace:

  Whether to record trace for each test. Defaults to 'off'.

'off': Do not record trace.
'on': Record trace for each test.
'retain-on-failure': Record trace for each test, but remove all traces from successful test runs.
'on-first-retry': Record trace only when retrying a test for the first time.
'on-all-retries': Record traces only when retrying for all retries.
For more control, pass an object that specifies mode and trace features to enable.

Usage

// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry'
  },
});


   // headless: false,  // by default playwright runs headless, setting to false will make the test run in browser(s)


Run specific test from terminal with desired browser:
add "only" after test "test.only('check java page'....." and run the test
"$ npx playwright test <file path> --project=chromium"
$ npx playwright test tests/ --project=chromium

$ npx playwright test tests-examples/ --project=chromium

Run specific test spec in debug mode:
$ npx playwright test tests-examples/ --project=chromium --debug
